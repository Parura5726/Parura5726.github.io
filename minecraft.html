        This is a script to install minecraft on the school computers.
    <br>
        IMPORTANT: First time you run it, close the minecraft launcher as soon as it fully loads, after the language selection dialogue.
    <br>
        IMPORTANT: When you run this installer, log in to minecraft and install instances/mods, do
        it on a personal hotspot, otherwise this script will break
    <br>
        To run this, download the file below, install Visual Studio Code (from filewave), open it,
        press <code>ctrl+`</code> (backtick), and type in <code>chmod +x ~/Downloads/minecraft</code>
        if you're running this for the first time, then, and for any subsequent time you want to run
        it, <code>~/Downloads/minecraft</code>.
    <br>
        <a href="./minecraft">Download</a>
    <br>
        In case the script doesn't work, try again from <code>chmod +x ~/Downloads/minecraft</code> and
        change <code>~/Downloads/minecraft</code> to <code>bash ~/Downloads/minecraft</code>.
    <br>
        If it still doesn't work, type in <code>cd ~ && rm -rf Apps && rm Downloads/minecraft</code>
        (THIS WILL DELETE ALL YOUR WORLDS/INSTANCES) and repeat instructions from the start
